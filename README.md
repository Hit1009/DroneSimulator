# ThreeJsDemo

A primitive flight simulator running on web browser with ThreeJS made in 2 months

The goal behind this project was to improve my shader programming skills and to get some basic knowledges with web langages.

[Report of the project (FR)](documentation/CompteRendu.md)

## Features

- Web assembly for high performance generation algorithms
- Infinite procedural landscape generation
- Primitive foliage system
- Basic atmospheric scattering shader
- Tree impostors

## Live demo

A live demo of this project is available [here](https://pierreeven.github.io/demos.html)
(please keep in mind that the high settings require a high-end GPU. Prefer lower presets for laptop or mobile devices)
